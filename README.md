# Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of using bots to extract content and data from a website. Unlike screen scraping, which only copies pixels displayed onscreen, web scraping extracts underlying HTML code and, with it, data stored in a database. The scraper can then replicate entire website content elsewhere.

Web scraping, also known as web data extraction, is formally known as the process of obtaining and structuring data from the web using intelligent
automation.
It can be used to potentially retrieve hundreds, millions, or even billions of data points from the internetâ€™s seemingly endless frontier.

## Ethics of Scraping

* Do not engage in piracy or other unauthorized commercial use regarding the data you extract.
* Read the ToS and robots.txt of the site you are about to scrape.
* Do not spam the website with multiple requests in a short amount of time, as that may hurt them and/or may be classified as a DDOS attack.
